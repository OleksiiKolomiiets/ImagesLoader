# ImagesLoader

ImagesLoader is cool app where I've implemented a lot of features and improved my iOS Development skills.

There are three tabs:
 - Loaded images: photo by three random categories displayed via table and collection views(to put there any image just drag it from table view).
 - Favorite images: list of image that you like ( to put there image just drag it from table view and drop to highlight zone).
 - Map with images: there you can find from 5 to 10 images by tag you wrote on search field. 
 
 Every 30sec all Loaded images are reloading with three random tags.
